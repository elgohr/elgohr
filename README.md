### Hi there, I'm Lars 👋

<!--
**elgohr/elgohr** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->

This is the place where I tinker and opensource things.  
Projects are not related to my employer.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on trying not to break things 🤣
- 🌱 I’m learning every day
- 👯 I’m looking for inspiring things
- ⚡ Fun fact: I made the worlds first Android hand warmer, using C.
