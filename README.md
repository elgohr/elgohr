**elgohr/elgohr** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

This is the place where I tinker and opensource things.
Projects are not related to my employer.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on trying not to break things ğŸ¤£
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning every day
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for inspiring things
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: [@lagohr][twitter] or say ğŸ‘‹ on Email at [Lars Gohr](mailto:lars@gohr.digital)
